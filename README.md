# Express-Routing-Checkpoint

Express routing checkpoint. Here, I used Express with Nodejs to create a server and handle routes.  
I implemented a custom middleware to verify the time a user
make a request to a web app routes and reder a response accodingly.

The pages are styled using pure CSS on ejs templating engine.
